# Go API Server for openapi

The GoPort API extends the Docker Engine API to connect to remote Hosts by
serving a context endpoint. It also adds the ability to manage docker-compose projects.

# Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following
format:

```
{
  \"message\": \"page not found\"
}
```


## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it openapi 
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
